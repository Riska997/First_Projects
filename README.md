# Java Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of simple Java projects that demonstrate various concepts and technologies, including Java console applications, Swing, JavaFX, and MySQL integration. Each project showcases different aspects of Java development, from basic console input/output to graphical user interfaces and database interactions.

## Projects Overview

- **Console Applications:**
  - These projects demonstrate basic Java programming concepts using console input and output.
  
- **Swing Applications:**
  - These projects use Java Swing to create graphical user interfaces with components like buttons, text fields, and panels.
  
- **JavaFX Applications:**
  - These projects utilize JavaFX for modern UI components and enhanced user experience.

- **MySQL Integration:**
  - These projects demonstrate how to connect Java applications to a MySQL database for data storage and retrieval.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Riska997/First_Projects.git


2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd project-directory

3. **Compile and Run the Project**

### For Console Applications:

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main

### For Swing and JavaFX Applications:

```bash
javac -cp .:path/to/javafx/lib/* Main.java
java -cp .:path/to/javafx/lib/* Main


### For MySQL Projects:

```bash
javac -cp .:path/to/mysql-connector-java.jar Main.java
java -cp .:path/to/mysql-connector-java.jar Main

## Troubleshooting
- **Console Applications:**
  -Ensure you have the correct JDK installed and configured in your system's PATH.

- **Swing Applications:**
  -Check for any missing dependencies or library imports.

- **JavaFX Applications:**
  - the JavaFX SDK is properly set up and included in your classpath.

- **MySQL Integration:**
  -Verify your MySQL server is running and accessible.
  -Check database connection details (username, password, database name) in the code.
